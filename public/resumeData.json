    "bio": "Hi! I am Joshua!. I've been coding for over 5 years As a Full Stack self-taught software developer. I've worked both with startups and large corporations to help build & scale their company's challenges. Aside from a developer and staring at a computer screen all day, I'm a competitive project manager. I taught myself project management through Google's Project Manager Prefesional certificate on Coursera. Although this might feel irrelevant to you but believe me, Project management has to do with everything tied to any project, from starting a project and closing a project. It may surprise you also as I have a skill in Data analysisðŸ˜Š. Yes, Data analysis through IBM as a self-taught data analyst. ",
